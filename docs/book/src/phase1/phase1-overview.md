# Phase 1 Overview: Command-Line Client

![Phase 1 Overview](./images/phase1-overview.svg)

In the first phase of the project, you will build the **command-line client** that serves as the user interface for your
database system. The client is intentionally "dumb" - it handles user interaction and presentation but sends raw SQL
strings to the server without parsing them. This phase focuses on creating an excellent user experience and establishing
patterns for client-server communication.

## Learning Objectives

By completing Phase 1, you will gain practical experience in:

- **CLI Design**: Creating intuitive and responsive command-line interfaces
- **User Experience**: Building tools that are pleasant and efficient to use
- **Input Handling**: Supporting multiple input methods and edge cases
- **Output Formatting**: Presenting data in readable and attractive formats
- **Configuration Management**: Handling settings from multiple sources
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Writing code that works across operating systems

## What You'll Build

### Core Features

- **Interactive SQL Shell**: A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for SQL commands
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Interactive, file, pipe, and direct command execution
- **Beautiful Output**: Formatted tables with proper alignment and borders
- **Raw SQL Handling**: Accept SQL commands as strings, no parsing required
- **Command History**: Arrow key navigation and auto-completion
- **Configuration**: Flexible settings management
- **Network Client**: Prepared for Phase 2 server communication

```

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Basic CLI Structure

Set up the fundamental command-line interface that can accept SQL commands and return mock responses. Establish the
patterns for different input methods.

### Task 2: Interactive Shell Implementation

Build a full-featured REPL with readline support, command history, and auto-completion for SQL keywords.

### Task 3: Output Formatting

Create beautiful table output with automatic column sizing, proper alignment, and Unicode borders. Support multiple
output formats.

### Task 4: Command-Line Arguments

Implement comprehensive argument parsing with help text, version information, and configuration options.

### Task 5: Configuration Management

Support configuration from command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files with proper priority
handling.

### Task 6: Error Handling

Implement user-friendly error handling with syntax suggestions and clear error messages.

## Success Criteria

### Functionality

- ✅ Accepts SQL commands through all input methods
- ✅ Displays formatted output beautifully
- ✅ Provides helpful error messages and suggestions
- ✅ Supports command history and line editing
- ✅ Responds quickly to user input (< 100ms)

### Code Quality

- ✅ Clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases
- ✅ Good test coverage for critical functionality
- ✅ Clear documentation and code comments
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

### User Experience

- ✅ Intuitive interface that's easy to learn
- ✅ Responsive and fluid interactions
- ✅ Helpful prompts and auto-completion
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different platforms

## Performance Requirements

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Startup Time | < 500ms | Users expect tools to start quickly |
| Command Response | < 100ms | Interactive tools must feel responsive |
| Memory Usage | < 50MB | CLI tools should be lightweight |
| Table Formatting | < 1s for 10K rows | Large results should display efficiently |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Command-line argument parsing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Table formatting algorithms
- Configuration loading and merging
- Error message generation

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end CLI workflow testing
- File and pipe input processing
- Output format validation
- Cross-platform compatibility

### User Experience Tests

- Interactive shell responsiveness
- Command history and auto-completion
- Error handling and recovery
- Terminal compatibility across different emulators

## Common Challenges

**⚠️ Common Pitfalls:**

- **Terminal Compatibility**: Different terminals handle escape sequences differently
- **Unicode Support**: Box-drawing characters may not display correctly on all systems
- **Input Buffering**: Managing input streams properly across different platforms
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful handling of Ctrl+C and other interrupt signals
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large result sets and command history

## Preparation for Phase 2

Your Phase 1 client should be architected to easily integrate with a network server:

- **Network Module**: Prepare abstractions for TCP communication
- **Protocol Handling**: Design for JSON request/response processing
- **Error Handling**: Plan for network-related errors and timeouts
- **Configuration**: Include server host/port settings

## Language-Specific Considerations

### Rust

- Use `clap` for argument parsing and `rustyline` for readline
- Leverage `tokio` for async networking preparation
- Consider `tabled` for table formatting

### C++

- Use `CLI11` or similar for arguments and `readline` library
- Plan for cross-platform networking with `boost::asio`
- Implement custom table formatting

### Go

- Use `cobra` for CLI framework and `liner` for readline
- Leverage built-in networking capabilities
- Use `tablewriter` for output formatting

### Python

- Use `click` for CLI and `prompt_toolkit` for advanced input
- Consider `asyncio` for future networking
- Use `tabulate` for table display

### Java

- Use `picocli` for CLI and `JLine` for readline functionality
- Plan for NIO networking in subsequent phases
- Consider ASCII table libraries for formatting

## Ready to Start?

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for your entire database system. The client you build will be used for testing and
interacting with all subsequent phases, so invest time in making it robust and user-friendly.

**Next**: Begin with [Task 1: Basic CLI Structure](./phase1-01-cli-structure.md) to start building your command-line
client.

# Preface

Welcome to the **Real Engineer Project** - a comprehensive journey to build a complete database management system from scratch. This project is designed to transform students into real engineers by providing deep understanding of how client-server systems, network protocols, and storage engines work together in production environments.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike theoretical computer science courses or simple tutorials, this project focuses on building a **production-quality three-tier system**:

1. **Command-Line Client**: Interactive SQL shell with excellent user experience
2. **Network Server**: Multi-threaded TCP server with robust error handling  
3. **Database Engine**: SQL parser, query processor, and persistent B+ tree storage

## Learning Philosophy

This project follows the philosophy that **real engineering is learned by building real systems**. You'll encounter the same challenges that database engineers face daily:

- **Concurrency**: Handling multiple clients safely and efficiently
- **Persistence**: Ensuring data survives crashes and restarts
- **Performance**: Optimizing for real-world workloads
- **Reliability**: Building systems that work consistently under stress

## Who This Is For

This guide is designed for:

- **Computer Science Students** who want to understand systems programming
- **Software Engineers** looking to deepen their database knowledge
- **Self-Taught Developers** seeking practical systems experience
- **Anyone** curious about how databases really work

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Experience**: Intermediate proficiency in at least one systems language (Rust, C++, Go, Java, Python)
- **Basic Networking**: Understanding of TCP/IP and client-server concepts
- **Data Structures**: Familiarity with hash maps, trees, and basic algorithms
- **Unix Systems**: Comfortable with command-line tools and development environments

## How to Use This Guide

Each phase builds incrementally:

1. **Read the Overview**: Understand the goals and architecture
2. **Complete Tasks Sequentially**: Each task builds on the previous ones
3. **Run Tests Frequently**: Validate your implementation at each step
4. **Study the Concepts**: Use the "Test Your Understanding" sections
5. **Experiment**: Try the bonus tasks and optimizations

## Time Commitment

The project is designed as an 18-week course:

- **Phases 1-2**: Client and Server (4-6 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: SQL Processing (6 weeks) 
- **Phase 4**: Persistent Storage (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Production Features (2-4 weeks)

However, you can work at your own pace. Some experienced developers complete it in a few intensive weeks, while others take several months learning deeply along the way.

## Community and Support

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for each phase
- **Testing Framework**: Language-agnostic validation of your implementation
- **Reference Implementation**: Study the provided Rust implementation
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions

## Ready to Begin?

Building a database system is one of the most rewarding projects in computer science. You'll gain deep appreciation for the elegant algorithms and careful engineering that power the systems we use every day.

**Let's build something amazing together.**

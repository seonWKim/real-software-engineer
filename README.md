# Real Engineer Project: Build Your Own Database System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Real Engineer Project - a comprehensive, hands-on journey to build a complete database management
system (RDBMS) from scratch. This project is designed to transform students into real engineers by providing deep
understanding of how databases, servers, operating systems, and programming languages work together in production
systems.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

## Language-Agnostic Testing Strategy

### üß™ Testing Framework

To ensure implementations work correctly regardless of programming language, all tests use standardized interfaces:

#### 1. Client Interface Testing (Phase 1)

- **Method**: Command-line interface testing with standardized input/output
- **Input**: SQL commands via stdin or command-line arguments
- **Output**: Formatted table results via stdout in JSON or tab-separated format
- **Verification**: Text comparison of output with expected results
- **Example**: `echo "SELECT * FROM users;" | ./my_client` ‚Üí compare with expected output
- **Benefits**: Easy to test, debug, and verify across all programming languages

#### 2. Network Protocol Testing (Phase 2+)

- **Method**: TCP socket communication using JSON protocol (human-readable)
- **Test Suite**: Automated scripts that connect to server and send JSON messages
- **Protocol**: Simple JSON format: `{"type": "query", "sql": "SELECT * FROM users"}`
- **Response**: JSON format: `{"status": "success", "data": [...], "error": null}`
- **Language Support**: JSON parsing available in all modern languages
- **Example**: Test runner connects, sends query, verifies JSON response structure

#### 3. SQL Compliance Testing (Phase 3+)

- **Standard**: Subset of SQL-92 specification with clearly defined grammar
- **Test Cases**: Progressive SQL complexity from simple SELECT to complex JOINs
- **Format**: `.sql` files with corresponding `.json` expected results
- **Validation**: JSON comparison with tolerance for floating-point precision
- **Client Integration**: All tests run through the client interface for consistency

#### 4. Performance Benchmarking

- **Datasets**: Standardized test datasets of various sizes (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M records)
- **Metrics**: Query execution time, memory usage, disk I/O
- **Reporting**: JSON-formatted performance reports for automated analysis
- **Baseline**: Reference implementation benchmarks for comparison

### üéØ Test Execution

```bash
# Phase 1: Test client interface with mock data
./test_runner.sh --phase 1 --client ./my_client

# Phase 2: Test client + server communication  
./test_runner.sh --phase 2 --client ./my_client --server ./my_server

# Phase 3+: Full end-to-end testing
./test_runner.sh --phase 3 --client ./my_client --server ./my_server

# All phases with performance benchmarking
./test_runner.sh --all --client ./my_client --server ./my_server --benchmark
```

### üìä Test Reporting

- **Correctness**: Pass/fail for each test case with detailed error messages
- **Performance**: Execution time and resource usage statistics
- **Compliance**: SQL standard compliance percentage
- **Progress**: Phase completion tracking with visual progress indicators
